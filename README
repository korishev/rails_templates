This is my template. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

You probably won't have any use for it beyond casual voyeurism.

Bits shamelessly stolen for too many places to mention.  Thanks everyone!

This template won't work with a base rails 3.0.0 install.  There is a bug in the 
template processing code in Rails, that I've patched locally.  The bug attempts
to simply append any code spcified in the "environment" section to the end of the
environments/whatever.rb file.  With Rails 3.0, that's not the correct behavior,
you have to place them before the last "end" in the file.  

I've included the patch file in the repo, so if you feel you must, go ahead :)

template includes:

  haml
  pg  (postgresql)
  rspec
  rspec-rails
  factory-girl
  devise
  declaratve_authorization
  heroku
